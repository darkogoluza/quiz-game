# Intent
I want to create some sort of web game. I was thinking for some time about what I could make, and then it hit me. I could make a quiz game because it would practice my skill with working with APIs. I was searching for what API I could use and I stumbled upon [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/). It was an obvious choice because they provide different parameters from which you can choose what category you want or for example what difficulty you want your questions to be.

# Process
This project was not challenged as I expected it to be, maybe that is just because I already had previous experience in creating games. For creating graphics I used a color palette I found online and from that, I designed the UI. I was also experimenting with adding transition animations. The API was made to allow me to make callbacks with custom parameters so I can filter between what category and what difficulty I want my questions to be. 

# End Result
In the end, I was left with a simple game that is responsive to mobile devices. My goal was satisfied because creating a game is a bit different than creating a regular website, so it has allowed me to think with a broader mindset when it comes to creating websites.
